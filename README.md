# NumericalMethodsCourse

A repository for my MAT370 course (Numerical Analysis). The course follows Jaan Kiusalaas' textbook Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3. 
In all honesty, this is much more a Numerical Methods course than on on Numerical Analysis.
You can [see the webpage for the course here](https://agmath.github.io/NumericalAnalysis.html).
