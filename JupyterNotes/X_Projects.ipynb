While I have a list of potential project topics below, a wide variety of options for MAT370 projects will be considered and you are welcome to propose your own.\n","\n","Your project should relate to a topic you are genuinely interested in since you'll be working on it for the final three weeks of our semester. If you have other final projects that you are working on, I am open to you tying your MAT370 project into another project as long as the connection makes sense and your other faculty member agrees that pursuing such a joint project is okay with them.\n","\n","## Sample Project Topics\n","\n","Some example project topics are:\n","\n","+ **New Numerical Techniques:**\n","  + Weighted Least Squares\n","  + Multiple Integration\n","+ **New [Numerical] Techniques in Data Science:**\n","  + Nearest Neighbors Algorithms\n","  + Naive Bayes Classification Algorithms\n","  + Tree-Based Regression and Classification Algorithms\n","  + Data Clustering Techniques\n","  + Principal Components Analysis\n","  + Neural Networks\n","+ **Surveys of Covered Techniques:**\n","  + Numerical Methods in My Major...\n","  + When Numerical Methods go Wrong...\n","\n","The topics under **New Numerical Techniques** are covered in our textbook. The topics under **New [Numerical] Techniques in Data Science** are covered in *Data Science from Scratch*, a textbook I have in my office. The **Surveys of Covered Techniques** topic invites you to think about how numerical methods can be applied to problems relevant to your major or to think about limitations to our numerical methods. There are lots of interesting examples in history when a misunderstanding or misuse of numerical methods has ended in disaster. If your major is Electrical or Mechanical Engineering, perhaps you've seen some relevant applications already, but extending this to topics you've seen throughout your curriculum would be interesting.\n","\n","## Project Requirements\n","\n","Because of the variety of projects being considered, a one-size-fits-all rubric won't be possible. Below are some basic guidelines.\n","\n","  + All projects must take the form of a technical paper written in a Jupyter Notebook (via either Google Colab or your local machine). Complete sentences, paragraph structure, etc. are expected and required.\n","  + All projects must discuss at least one numerical method. Survey projects which look back on methods we've covered in our course must look at several (at least three) methods.\n","  + All projects must provide working implementations of numerical methods discussed. You must code your implementation from scratch, using only basic libraries such as `numpy`. For example `from scipy.cluster import KMeans` is not a permissible implementation of K-Means Clustering for the purposes of this project.\n","  + All projects must include examples of numerical methods being applied. Those examples should be clearly discussed and their relevance should be made obvious in your discussions.\n","  + All projects must include references and any appropriate inline citations. The method of citation is yours to choose -- you may go full APA or MLA, or may choose to do something more lax. For example, in the sciences, it is common to make inline citations like,\n","    > As mentioned in [1], `numpy` begins indexing from $0$, while `matlab` begins indexing from $1$.
