This is perhaps counterintuitive since we typically think of more data as \"better\" since it is additional information. The problem with polynomial interpolation is that additional data points increase the degree of the polynomial interpolant. This can result in polynomials that fluctuate wildly between observed data points.\n","\n","If we have more than just a few observed data points to work with, a cubic spline is a great option for an interpolant. Cubic splines consist of two main components (i) *pins* (or *knots*) are the observed data points that the interpolant is required to pass through, and (ii) *elastic strips* correspond to \"unloaded beams\" connecting observed data points. For those with a background in engineering, you may remember that the deflection ($w$) of an unloaded beam between two connection points with constant flexural rigidity satisfies $\\displaystyle{\\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = \\frac{q\\left(x\\right)}{EI}}$, where $q\\left(x\\right)$ denotes the *load* at position $x$ along the beam. Since the beam is *unloaded*, we have $\\displaystyle{\\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = 0}$, so the elastic strip is a cubic.\n","\n","Cubic splines have some additional nice properties.
