Some tips to get you started are:\n","\n","+ Colab notebooks consist of text/markdown cells (white background) and code cells (grey background).\n","+ **Text Cells:** You can write anything you like in the white background text cells. You can make use of the formatting buttons, or of markdown syntax and basic HTML if you know any.\n","  + There is, unfortunately, no spell-check in these text cells.\n","  + To finalize/render a text cell, you can use `Shift+Enter`.\n","  + To update a text cell, you can double-click inside of it to open up the editor.\n","\n","+ **Code Cells:** The cells with grey background are Python code cells.\n","\n","  + You can write and execute Python code here. To execute your code cell, you can use `Shift+Enter`.\n","  + If/when you write broken code, an error traceback will be printed out below the code cell. The most informative portion of the traceback is generally the last line. Colab will underline the offending section(s) of code in red.\n","  + It is important to note that code cells are generally \"aware\" of modules, variables, methods, routines, etc. that have been created as part of *previous* code cells, but not of objects created in later code cells.\n","\n","    + Restarting your session (`Runtime -> Restart Session`) and then running your notebook from the top down every once in a while will keep you aware of any upstream/downstream issues you have.\n","\n","+ **LaTeX:** We'll often have the need to type mathematics as part of our explanations/solutions. For now, you should know that mathematics goes *between* dollar signs (\\$).\n","\n","We've done a bit of work already this semester with Text and Code cells, so let's start with an introduction to $\\LaTeX$."],"metadata":{"id":"5iHTTxoW5UR-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Using $\\LaTeX$ in Google Colab\n","\n","> *Note.* If you haven't used $\\LaTeX$ before, then what appears below is new and perhaps overwhelming. I'd like you to try typing up the mathematics for our course, but you'll largely be able to copy/paste/edit math-type from our daily notebooks while you become more familiar with typestting mathematics.\n",">> You will be permitted to insert images of hand-written work into your Colab Notebooks if typing the mathematics becomes burdensome to you. You can [follow these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50670920/how-to-insert-an-inline-image-in-google-colaboratory-from-google-drive) for embedding images from Google Drive into a Colab Notebook. The first response, from Alejandro NuÃ±ez-Arroyo is the one to follow.\n","\n","LaTeX is a very commonly used markup language in mathematics and the sciences -- it is how we'll format mathematics. We'll begin to get familiar with LaTeX below.\n","\n","+ Any math type should go between dollar signs (\\$).  \n","  + For example, $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$ is one of the most beautiful identities in all of mathematics!\n","+ If your text starts formatting $like this, then you've forgotten a dollar sign somewhere$.\n","+ If you have a mathematical statement that formats like this: $\\cos\\left(e^{i\\theta})$, then you have mismatches between opening and closing parentheses or brackets. This particular issue will happen quite often -- I'll help you troubleshoot.\n","+ If you'd like to include a symbol, but you don't know the code for it, check [detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). You can also ask me if detexify was unhelpful.\n","\n","Get some practice by completing the tasks below."],"metadata":{"id":"IjFPnpDr_s_J"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task 1:** Put a dollar sign before and after the function f(x) = x^2 - 4 in this markdown cell to format the mathematics correctly."],"metadata":{"id":"gJqUUMW6s9V1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task 2:** We'll sometimes want to utilize fractions, we can do this using \\frac{numerator}{denominator}.

Using `begin{align}` and `end{align}` creates an environment for aligned equations -- you don't need the dollar signs when using this environment. The characters immediately after the ampersand (`&`) on each line will be aligned. You can try moving them as well to see what happens.\n","\n","**Task 3:** Try typing your own step-by-step solution to the $\\frac{3x - 5}{4} = 10$.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"K0F5ILsdtXGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Arrays: Systems, Matrices, and Vectors\n","\n","We'll be working with systems of equations, matrices, and vectors often in this course.
